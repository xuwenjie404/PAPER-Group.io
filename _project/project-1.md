title: "A Novel Signal-Power Integrated Gate Driver Design for MV SST Applications"
excerpt: "Isolated gate drivers (GDs) for medium-voltage (MV) solid-state transformers (SSTs) must satisfy a set of stringent requirements, including high insulation rating and high common-mode transient immunity. To simultaneously improve PWM signal quality (duty cycle range and propagation delay) while maintaining compact dimensions, wireless power transfer (WPT) techniques are promising solutions, thanks to their inherent insulation gap and flexible coil shape and structure. In this paper, a new signal-power integrated wireless GD concept is proposed. Unlike existing pulse transformer-based GD solutions, which directly transfers On/Off PWM edge signals from the control side to the MV power side, the proposed approach only transfers DC voltage levels through the shared WPT channel to generate PWM with indexes such as duty cycle and frequency locally at the MV power side, which is a brand-new isolated gate driving concept. The proposed design utilizes multi-frequency resonant networks and a shared WPT channel to transfer the DC voltage indexes and gate driving power simultaneously. The design method and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness and functionalities of the proposed isolated GD design <br/><img src='/images/WPTDriverPrototype.png'>"

This paper proposes a novel signal-power co-transmission method with a single PCB WPT coupler for MV GD design, utilizing ual-frequency resonant WPT technology. GD signals and power are decoupled in different frequency domains to ensure stable power transmission across the full duty cycle range. The WPT coils meet the isolation strength of 10 kVrms. Experimental results have verified the functions and effectiveness of the proposed GD approach.
