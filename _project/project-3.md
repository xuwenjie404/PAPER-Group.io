title: "P3 Coreless PCB Coupler in MV SiC Application"
excerpt: "In this paper, a novel concentric circular coil-based coreless print-circuit-board (PCB) coupler is proposed for gate driver (GD) isolated power supply for medium voltage (MV) application. In comparison to the existing design, the proposed concentric circular coreless PCB coupler structure can achieve ultra-low parasitic capacitance, high insulation capacity, and high mutual inductance at a low cost and in compact dimensions, thanks to the ring-embedded structure design. In addition, an optimization methodology balancing mutual inductance, parasitic capacitance, and insulation is analyzed and provided. The regulated voltage gain of the resonant converter is analyzed. The simulation and experimental results show that the parasitic capacitance is 0.9 pF for over 100 kV/μs dv/dt immunity condition, and the partial discharge (PD) test shows insulation strength achieves MV ratings. <br/><img src='/images/Overview.png'>"

This paper proposes a new concentric circular coil-based coreless PCB coupler for MV gate driver isolated power supplies. The proposed ring-embedded design effectively balances coupling performance with high-voltage standards, achieving excellent results with an ultra-low parasitic capacitance of 0.9 pF, and improved mutual inductance. Its insulation strength achieves MV ratings while maintaining compact size. A 1.5-W S-LCC resonant topology is examined for regulated voltage gain. These results validate the proposed PCB coupler as a reliable, high-performance solution for MV power electronics, offering notable advantages over traditional isolation methods in size, cost, and electrical performance.
