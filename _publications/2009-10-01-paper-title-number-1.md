excerpt:  "Wirelesspowertransfer(WPT)hasdrawnmore and more attention and has many applications, such as
 wireless electric vehicle charging systems, which require highpower,highefficiency,andhighpowerfactor.Inthispaper, a single-stage WPT resonant converter with bridgeless boost power-factor-correction (PFC) rectifier is proposed to improve efficiency and power quality of line input, and reduce production cost and complexity for high-power WPT system. The bridgeless single-stage topology is creatively proposed to apply in WPT system, which is much more advantageous than conventional two-stage WPT converter with individual boost PFC stage. <br/><img src='/images/Single-Stage WPT.jpg'>"
